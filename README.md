# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains my personal notes and Jupyter notebooks on Deep Learning Specialization course at the university [Haute-Alsace](https://www.uha.fr/en/index.html).

I'm enjoying every little bit of the course, hope you enjoy my notes too.

This course contains seven chapters. the seven chapters titles are:

- MLP
- [Autoencoder & Variational Autoencoder](https://github.com/yassine-rd/deep-learning-course/tree/master/2-%20Autoencoder%20&%20Variational%20Autoencoder)
- GAN
- Explainability
- Self-attention / Transformers
- Self-supervised Learning
- Object Detection

## About the course

> Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought-after tech skills.
>
> In this course, I will learn advanced concepts of neural networks and deep learning, and understand the recent architectures and their use cases. I will also be implementing a multilayer perceptron network from scratch in Python.
>
> AI is transforming multiple industries. After finishing this specialization course, I will likely find creative ways to apply it to my work.
